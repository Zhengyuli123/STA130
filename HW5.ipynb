    "Problem Introduction:\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment is to analyze whether students in the STA130 course can discern the order in which milk and tea are poured into a cup. This inquiry is inspired by the famous experiment conducted by statistician Ronald Fisher and his colleague Dr. Muriel Bristol in the 1920s, where Bristol claimed she could tell the difference based on the order of pouring. In this report, we conduct a similar experiment with a sample of STA130 students to evaluate whether their ability to identify the pouring order is statistically significant or merely a result of random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Between This Experiment and the Original with Fisher and Bristol:\n",
    "Fisher's original study involved a single participant who tasted eight cups of tea prepared in two different orders (milk first or tea first). Bristol successfully identified the pouring order, prompting Fisher to question whether her performance exceeded what would be expected from chance alone. Our experiment extends this concept by testing a larger group of 80 STA130 students, each of whom tasted a cup of tea and reported whether they believed the milk or tea was poured first. This broader sample allows us to generalize findings about student perception while still focusing on the fundamental question of whether pouring order affects taste."
