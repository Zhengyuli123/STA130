    "1: If the analysis finds a strong relationship between number of friends and well-being, this would strongly support that social connection is vital for mental health. Thus, this could inspire us students and any other people to understand the importance of social relationships and take more time and effort to engage in building and maintaining relationships among people.\n",
    "2: This project enables students to apply theoretical knowledge to a real dataset, enhancing their understanding of data analysis in a community context. Hence, we can better our ability in statistics and becomre more capable for future anlyses regarding these related incidents.\n",
    "3: If the project identifies critical statistics showing how number of friends benefits health, it could serve as a basis for deeper studies and potential Rapid Evidence Briefs. Policymakers or community leaders might use these findings to advocate for programs that foster social connections for people to establish relationships with each other."
